The following feedback includes only the portions that you pushed something for.
I found that the scores are not associated with the problems. Will fix them
soon.

1. 
  Q2: great. you will get the full score
2. 
  Q1: count doesn't seem to work. Let me know if it should work.
  Q2: prevent doesn't seem to work. The module is not preventing open nor
  - I thing the reason why the module do not work is that you hardcoded your
  name, which seem to be your VM's account name. Please use vagrant as the user
  name which is the default one. Otherwise your code appears to work.
3.
  Q1: This also does not work. One reason is you user id but there is another.
  In fact, you should hook unlinkat instead of unlink.
