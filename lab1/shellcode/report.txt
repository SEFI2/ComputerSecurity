Q1. 
Yes! It executes the assembler code (shellcode.S) , which is similar to shellcode.c. The code itself tries to access and execute the `/bin/sh` program(which is by itself a `shell`) by using the `execve` function.

Q2.
We can find the address of the buffshell ( by using gdb `p &bufshell`)
and using this address for return address. 
So at the end.
char buf[(OFFSET+5)] = "12345678as\xa2\xeb\xff\xbf";
	

Q3.
We can use the converted hexadecimal representation of the assembler code (shellcode.S) and writing it in reverse order.
