Q1.

`0804b000-0806c000 [heap]`
and 
`bffdf000-c0000000 [stack]`

We can find them by reading the rightmost column, which describes the heap and stack and where leftmost describes the range of addresses.



Q2.
We can filter out them by the permission access. We know that Code data should be only readable and the global variables only readable and writable.
We located them 

Code address range:
08049000-0804a000 r--p
Global Variables address range:
0804a000-0804b000 rw-p

Q3.
The region with rw-p for .data/.bss/heap/stack
The region with r--p for .rodata

Q4.
`layout-insecure` has more permisions for memory regions, which could lead to vulnerability holes.

Q5.
Aftering turning on ASLR, I observed that execution of ./layout displays different address range after each execution.
