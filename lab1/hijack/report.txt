Q1.
Current return address is 0xb7e21637 
And the current memory address where return adress is located is 0xbffff01c, which is right after the ebp register (which we want to override).

Q2.
We can executel shellcode function by inputing this value.
char buf[OFFSET] = "12341234123412341234\x9b\x84\x04\x08";
Where first 12 values are random symbols (to skip buffer and other variables or ergisters), and last 4 are address of shellcode in reverse order (cause of little-endian).
